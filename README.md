Executive summary 
This executive summary gives a broad overview of the sentiment analysis that was done using Python on Amazon earphone reviews. With a particular focus on boAtrockerz, Skullcandy, and JBL, the sentiment study sought to evaluate consumer attitudes and satisfaction levels for various earphone brands. 
The methodology for this research was gathering a sizable dataset of Amazon earphone reviews and managing missing values and text cleaning as part of data pretreatment. Sentiment analysis was performed using the Python Natural Language Processing (NLP) package. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling in our extensive examination of online earphone reviews from Flipkart and Amazon to identify underlying themes and user feelings. We generated a vocabulary and corpus for Amazon reviews subsequent to preparing the data using tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal. After training several LDA models, we finally settled on a two-topic model that had the best coherence (0.5129) and perplexity (-6.7887) scores. In the first topic, quality, bass, and battery life were highlighted as well as positive aspects and features of earbuds; in the second topic, user experience and product longevity were the main foci. In a similar vein, we meticulously preprocessed the Flipkart reviews, building a corpus and dictionary. A four-topic model with the highest coherence score of 0.566 and the lowest perplexity score of -6.758 was chosen after we trained a number of LDA models. The four themes that were found were: favorable reviews that highlighted the value and satisfaction of the product; problems with installation and functionality of the product; the features and functionality of audio products; and overall positive comments that highlighted the affordability and quality of the product.
Customers place a high importance on the longevity, battery life, and sound quality of earbuds, as demonstrated by both platforms. Reviews of Flipkart frequently touched on value, contentment, installation problems, and functionality. These insights enable Amazon and Flipkart to improve customer satisfaction and issue resolution by optimizing product development, improving marketing strategies, and improving customer support.
